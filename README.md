# Predicting-Missing-Pokemon-Stat

This project is coded in Python.

Pokemon in the Pokemon games are given six different stats to determine their power: HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. I wanted to see if the distribution followed some sort of pattern. Specifically, I wanted to see if we gave a machine five of the six types, could it reasonably predict the final stat.

The analysis was made using five different regression techniques:
* Random Forest Regression
* Linear Regression
* Decision Tree Regression
* Support Vector Regression
* Lasso Regression
